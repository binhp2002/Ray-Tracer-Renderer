# Ray-Tracer-Renderer

• Developed a Ray Tracing Renderer with the use of Python and Processing (OpenGL). 
• Created a 3D scene and produce 2D images of the scene by casting eye rays for each pixel, testing these rays for intersection with objects then using diffuse shading equation to find the color for each pixel.
• Enable ambient and specular terms for shading and cast rays at light sources to create shadow while also including reflection of objects onto the surface.
